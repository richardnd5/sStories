        About the creator.
        
        I am a professional musician who found an interest in software development after taking an electronic music course during my graduate work in music composition. I'm a self-taught developer who is obsessed with learning. Some of my lifelong goals are to make music accessible to as many people as I can, and create opportunities for people to be creative.

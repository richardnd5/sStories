        About the creator.
        
        I am a professional musician who found an interest in software development after taking an electronic music course during my graduate work in music composition. I'm a self-taught developer who is obsessed with learning. Some of my lifelong goals are to make music accessible to as many people as I can, and create opportunities for people to be creative.

            With the exception of the sparrow, chickadee, and robin sounds downloaded from freesounds.com, the sound effects were recorded in my closet. I filled a waste basket with water and splashed around, taped a metal wire to a rollerblade wheel for the fishing pole, a pencil in a music manuscript book, and the rest with sounds from my mouth. All edited in Logic Pro.
